# DLW
This is another Digital Light Wand software based on the ideas of Michael Ross (http://mrossphoto.com/wordpress32/dlwblog/)

It is based on 144 LED Adafruit stips (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1507) with a Arduino Mega, display shield and SD.

This DLW software is coded completely from scratch, preset to 288 Leds in two strips. It reads BMP files from SD and has an option for various delays.
There is also the possibility to add a Buzzer. Future planned features include a remote for a DSLR.

I'm not at all an experienced coder, so the thing looks quite messy... eventually I may (or may not) clean it up a bit.
