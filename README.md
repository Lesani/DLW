# DLW
This is another Digital Light Wand software based on the ideas of Michael Ross (http://mrossphoto.com/wordpress32/dlwblog/). While we borrowed the idea, the software itself is a complete write-from-scratch and offers different functionality than the DLW software out there today.

It is based on 2 144-LED Adafruit NeoPixel stips (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1507) with a Arduino Due, display shield and SD. It reads BMP files from SD and has an option for various delays, endless mode (and upcoming feature: wireless camera trigger.)

I'm not at all an experienced coder, so the thing looks quite messy... eventually I may (or may not) clean it up a bit.
